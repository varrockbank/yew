## investigating markup languages

Learned they are called "light markup languages".

Realized most "light markup languages" were made as shorthand HTML. 

Originally searched Google for every "light markup language". Instead,
realized I must see the LMLs that are rendered by Github, then work backwards from there.
As one HN user noted "Github is king". It is pointless to evaluate LMLs which are 
not supported by Github.

Most of the languages are tied to writing code documentation:
textile (ruby), rdoc (ruby), pod (perl), rst (python)

rdoc - seems unalive

pod - more verbose than MD without clear benefit if we don't need perl 

rst - sourcefile is non linear (citations and links at bottom of section). ceremonial requiring new line 

textile - leaks abstraction of the HTML

creole - seems okay if we needed variable interpolation, otherwise it's verbose 

wiki - too structured and powerful. meant for Wiki, makes sense.

This leaves Asciidoc vs Markdown vs Org.

One issue with Markdown is fragmented implementation and support.
"common Markdown" is used to describe the widely-supported subset of Markdown.
