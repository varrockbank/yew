# Motivation

I started grad school and sought to consistently snapshot my thoughts
private and intellectual. I hope to capture the evolution
of my beliefs and knowledge akin to a "devlog".

Before this I had unstructured and disorganized notes that disappeared into
the entropy. The only way to retrieve something is to exhaustively
scan everything. This is not conducive to incrementally building knowledge
which requires accurately reflecting on prior knowledge. I relied heavily
on my "first brain" which was unreliable and taxing.

I hope to offload the cognitive overload by "writing the data to disk".
This "second brain" and "personal knowledge management system" includes
a various spaces which involve different workflows, flow states, and
data structures.

The projects I was dealing included coding projects
and academic courses. Additionally, I treated my private life as a project
in the context of a "Yew Project". These are fundamentally different kinds of projects
with different workflows and stream of thoughts. In their attempts 
to be comprehensive and robust towards these varying use-case, other PKM systems 
have overfit and created too much complexity. Yew focuses on the core knowledge
management issues that crosscuts projects without attempting to handle every use-case and
creating complexity.

Software-as-a-services sell a perfected knowledge
management system. The issues I encounter:

- Making everyone happy. As such, they have to handle every use-case
  which means a steep learning curve and complexity.
- data portability and to a lesser degree data sovereignty
- input lag
- access on weak internet and devices

Yew exists because I think can solve these problems. Namely,
I just need to make myself happy.

## The name 

The name takes inspiration from the tree popularized by RuneScape.
Namely, the yew log. Yew takes some inspiration from
the practice of "devlogs".

## Virtues

1. Plaintext files
2. Directory structure as a means of organization
3. Version control
4. Metadata support for purposes of search / information retrieval
5. Accessible from small (smartphones) and large devices (laptops) on slow internet connection
6. Maintain backward compatibility
7. implementation follows specification. specification specification, specification.
   The specification should also provide guidance and recommendations on how implementations
   should handle various behaviors.
8. Amenable to information retrieval (search) and organization (tags)
9. Do not chase trends or appeal to compatibility for the sake of compatibility
10. Avoid overengineering and perfectionism

Yew leans towards specification, rather than implementation, on workflow conventions as to
that interop with readily available software/toolchains, namely on Unix systems.

Custom implementation and integration should be a backwards compatible extension.

This repository should be "self-hosting" and serve as a valid Yew Project.
