## Orgdown - A criticsm of 

Thread debating the naming of Org files:

"It can be abbreviated as OD or coolified to O↓ or even ⧬."  is ridiculous bikeshedding.
In general, bikeshedding raises concern about the community and their priorities on 
pragmatic matters. i.e. ergonomics and onboarding with Emacs is still a cliff face. 

In general, productizing and branding feels like a landgrab. 

It seems only "orgdown1" or "level 1" of orgmode is defined by this evangelist.
It feels arbitrary what should be orgmode1 vs orgmode2. The bigger issue is that 
there has not been followup on what actually orgmode2 is. It seems this effort
is in a zombie state. Then I read about this critiicsm: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29422654
which includes not enumerating what the "43 features" of orgmode1 are. 

TLDR: this is one's person effort to define a standard and it has generated ZERO 
critical mass around it, other than a extended debate about the name "orgdown" 
and some short-lived references thereafter.

Indeed, criticism of one's persons "standard": https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29419942.

The problem for a need to label The Thing as Orgdown is overblown.
The problem boils down to:

- Orgmode the software
- Syntax of Org files, which is often called Orgmode
- Org files, which are just called Org files.

This is easily solvable. I have been calling the syntax of Org files "Org syntax"
and will continue to do so. There is no ambiguity here. In terms of specific versions 
and their feature set, the author of "Orgdown" made zero advances and this remains one
person's arbitrary standard. In fact, none of the tooling outside of Emacs, including the 
blogging tool they use to make the website, has 100% feature parity. It's arbitrary. 

### Specification by implementation

The standard of Orgfiles is a function of the Emacs version.
It is specification thru implementation.

It is best to think in terms of what tool that operates on Org files that you
seek to have parity with.
