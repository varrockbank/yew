It was decided Orgmode would be the markup language of choice.

It's plaintext source is equally as readable and easy to learn as Markdown. In fact,
it is more logical. The places where Orgmode is verbose and structured, it was 
a good choice to be more verbose and structured. For example, properties. 

You also have checkboxes versus the convention of emojis in Markdown. 

Orgmode, atleast in Emacs, also has support for LaTeX output.
